# groove-radar-calculator
This program calculates groove radar values for StepMania charts using the algorithm for DDR singles charts. However, at the moment it will run on almost every StepMania chart (and you can add more types very easily).

Python is used for this, and requires the following additional libraries which can be installed using `pip install`:
- argparse
- mutagen
